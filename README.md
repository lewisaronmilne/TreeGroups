# TreeGroups
An unfinished Firefox extension with sidebar tabs that are organised into trees and groups. 

The old version of this extension I was working on a few years ago is available [here](https://github.com/lewisaronmilne/TreeGroups_Old). It is more feature comelete than this version.

## Current Goals

The current plan is to turn this into a working clone of Tree Style Tab before I can start adding features related to tab groups.
